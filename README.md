CS-250 Portfolio

1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
To interpret user needs, I look past the requested features to understand the underlying problem the user is trying to solve. Creating user stories bridges the gap between technical requirements and human experience. By using the format "As a [type of user], I want to [action] so that [benefit]," I ensure that every line of code serves a specific purpose. This process prevents "scope creep" and helps prioritize features based on the value they provide to the end-user rather than just technical complexity.

2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I approach development as an iterative cycle rather than a linear path. I prefer breaking a large, intimidating project into a Product Backlog of manageable tasks. In my future work, I hope to consistently incorporate Sprints and Daily Stand-ups. Sprints allow for frequent "pivots" based on feedback, while Stand-ups ensure that roadblocks are identified early. This Agile mindset ensures that the final product is high-quality and actually meets the current needs of the stakeholders.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team member means being a "force multiplier" for the group. It involves writing clean, well-documented code that others can easily maintain, participating honestly in Sprint Retrospectives to improve team velocity, and maintaining open lines of communication. A good developer doesn't just solve their own tickets; they assist teammates, engage in constructive code reviews, and remain adaptable when project requirements change mid-stream.
